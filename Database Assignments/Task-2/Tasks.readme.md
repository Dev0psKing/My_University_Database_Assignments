# Database Normalization Problem


Given the following unnormalized relation representing a library database:

**Books (Book_ID, Title, Author, Genre, Publisher, Publication_Year, ISBN, Price)**

## Questions

a) Define normalization in the context of database management systems (DBMS). Explain why normalization is essential for database design.

b) Normalize this relation into First Normal Form (1NF), Second Normal Form (2NF), Third Normal Form (3NF) and Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF).

c) For each normalization step (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) performed in Part (b), explain the specific functional dependencies present in the original relation and how they are addressed through normalization.

d) Discuss the advantages and potential drawbacks of achieving higher normal forms (3NF and BCNF) compared to lower normal forms (1NF and 2NF) in terms of database design, querying efficiency, and data integrity.
