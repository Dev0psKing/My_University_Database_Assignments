## Question
### E-commerce Database Design Scenario

Imagine you are a database administrator working for a small e-commerce company that sells a variety of products online. The company wants to enhance its database system to better manage its inventory, orders, and customers.

Consider the four entities: Product, Customer, Order, and Inventory.

## Tasks

1. Define the relationships between these entities and identify key attributes for each entity.

2. Translate the above four identified entities and attributes into tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys.

3. Create an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that visually represents the structure of the e-commerce company's database system. Include all entities, relationships, attributes, and keys identified in parts (1) and (2). Clearly indicate cardinality and participation constraints. Ensure the ER diagram is properly labelled and easy to understand.

4. Explain two differences between conceptual and physical design in this scenario, highlighting their respective roles.
