### Explanation
* Primary Keys uniquely identify each record in a table.
* Foreign Keys establish relationships between tables, linking records from one table to records in another.
* OrderDetails Table facilitates the Many-to-Many relationship between orders and products by including foreign keys referencing both Order and Product.
* Each entity's key attributes are defined to store relevant information for the e-commerce system.

## Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

This ER diagram visually represents the structure of the e-commerce company's database system, including all entities, relationships, attributes, and keys. It clearly indicates cardinality and participation constraints.

## Conceptual vs Physical Design

Here are two key differences between conceptual design and physical design in database development:

### 1. Level of Abstraction

#### Conceptual Design:
* **Role:** Focuses on defining the overall structure and organization of the database. It represents the entities, relationships, and constraints without concern for how they will be implemented.
* **Example in Scenario:** Identifying entities like Product, Customer, Order, and Inventory, and defining relationships such as the one-to-many relationship between Customer and Order.

#### Physical Design:
* **Role:** Involves the actual implementation details of the database. It focuses on how data will be stored, indexed, and accessed in a database system.
* **Example in Scenario:** Creating SQL tables with data types, indexes, and specifying primary and foreign keys for entities like Product and Order.

### 2. Purpose and Audience

#### Conceptual Design:
* **Purpose:** Provides a clear model for stakeholders (such as business analysts and end-users) to understand the structure and relationships in the database. It helps in discussions and requirements gathering.
* **Audience:** Non-technical stakeholders and developers who need to agree on what data will be stored and how it will relate.

#### Physical Design:
* **Purpose:** Optimizes database performance and storage efficiency. It serves as a blueprint for database administrators and developers to implement the actual database.
* **Audience:** Technical stakeholders, such as database administrators and developers, who implement and manage the database.

### Summary
* Conceptual Design focuses on the "what" (entities and relationships) without implementation details.
* Physical Design focuses on the "how" (data storage and access methods) with technical specifications for implementation.

This README provides a comprehensive overview of database design for an e-commerce system, covering entity relationships, table structures, ER diagrams, and the differences between conceptual and physical design. It serves as an excellent learning resource for computer science students and aspiring database administrators.
